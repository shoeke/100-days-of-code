# 100 Days Of Code - Log (# missed days = 2, # completed = 24)

### Day 26: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**:FINSHED SASS BASICS AND ENTIRE WEB DESIGN TRACK IN TREEHOUSE. I was utterly crushed that there was no badge or success screen in TH after finishing the whole track!! That's bullshit!! Dopamine levels are low!!! I pushed through on the end of Sass and think I actually have a pretty decent understanding. Just a bit hazy on the more complex mixins with maps and loopings and conditional statements. The same areas I struggle in JS. Slowly getting it handled. 
**Thoughts** Not sure if SCSS is coming far and fast enough to not need Sass anymore. A bit confused on that!! Already seems like SCSS is used in writing both CSS straight up and in SASS. 

### Day 25: January 25, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**:continued work on Sass Basics in Treehouse and did some deep dives into articles recc by Rachel Andrew about css layout. Watched some Lynda videos on using tiling .svg graphics and animation in css. 
**Thoughts** There seems like so much potential repetition in css animations and pure css images, I would think those projects would pair really well with Sass. 

### Day 24: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Worked on Sass in Treehouse for 2 hours. I really like it. I think I'm a CSS nerd. Did a lot of reading today. 
**Thoughts** Reading and researching I know I'm really into CSS, including SVG and pure css art and animation and motion graphics. The SASS class was super cool and I'm getting excited about all the stuff css can do. I watched a Rachel Andrew talk all about css layout in 2019 and actually understood almost everything she was talking about!! Pulled up some articles she reccommended I want to follow up with. 1. Understanding Logical Properties And Values 2. How Big Is That Box? Understanding Sizing In CSS Layout (both are articles by her in Smashing) 3. More accessible markup with display: contents (by Hidde de Vries in code .) Made a long list of tuts to watch in Lynda.com regarding working with media assets in css and general asset development on the web. I think this is where I want to focus!!!


### Day 23: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Finished the Bootstrap4 section of Treehouse. I think it's very useful, just need to get used to finding what you are looking for and pratice doing the correct css selections in order to customize so there aren't so many identical websites out there. Just need to do the SASS section and I will have completed the whole Treehouse Web Design Track. It says I have 4 hours left!!!
**Thoughts** Read an interesting response in the FCC forum this morning regarding trying to find work when you are new to this at an older age. Their take was that you need to specialize in something very specific. They mentioned motion graphics or animation and I can't help but think that would be very interesting to me. Especially the .svg and css animations. Will try to focus on that. Also saw and ad for a JUNIOR WEB DEV that looked fun in Irvine. However, even though it was junior, the list of skills was so intimidating. Looks like I'll never be caught up. Errrrr. Trying to get a wide shallow coverage and then dive in deep somewhere. 



### Day 22: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:No true coding or even coding class today. Got to do a floorplan and there was Trev's birthday. Did work on MOOC for Mindshift a bit. 
**Thoughts** Onward and upward. 


### Day 21: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the bootstrap lessons in TreeHouse.Did another section that covered cards, which reminded me of figures in html. They can have different combos of images headlines and text but they organize super nicely together. Also list groups, exactly what they sound like. I find them a little more confusing although it looks like they are more improvised so more flexible. Then there was Modals which were like pop up windows and require javaScript. One more section to complete and that is on making forms. 
**Thoughts** It's a bit confusing knowing which snippets to copy. Also, is there a way to only keep the css you end up using, or do you always have a huge css file with bootstrap? Did a tiny bit of JS today. Need to work on that as well. 

### Day 20: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the bootstrap lessons in TreeHouse. It's going real slow with me trying to follow along in the workspace and jumping over to getbootstrap to grab the code. May continue on with the lessons without following along in real time. I wanted it to be helpful, but it's a bit distracting. Also did a bit more in JavaScript with Watch and Code.
**Thoughts** JavaScript reviewed arrays with indexing and push and splice. Did a practice on treehouse using those as well. Will continue on with these lessons. In bootstrap, worked on buttons, nav and navbar, and another menu for footer. Containers will maintain widths across the site. JS can be dropped in as well as elements with styles. Most of all I need to review the widths again. I know they are based on a 12 column grid, and you can tell it to use a set number of columns that begins at a certain breakpoint and goes up from there. Margins use the m with my being the margin top and bottom, and mx being margin left and right. Individual code is mt, mr, mb, ml for each side. Padding uses the exact same coding with the p substituted for the m. 

### Day 19: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:No real hands on coding today. What did I do? Trying to remember bc I feel like I did a good amount of reading on the subject. I checked on the FCC forum and was reading entries on other people who struggle with learning js. I did discover I am not allow. Two entries directed me to a site called Watch and Code. This young man is right here in Sunnyvale!! He says (and I completely agree) there is a ton of info available covering the beginning pieces of JS and of course a lot of advanced info, but nothing in the middle to help you string it all together. That's completely true. NOw I'm thinking most tech is like that (and art) Here are all the separate, primary pieces, now you go figure out how to use them. Gonna try doing his course over the next week and see how it goes. 
**Thoughts** Besides js, I also want to finish bootstrap and sass on treehouse. That should make me ready to take on Wordpress in February!! 

### Day 18: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:FINISHED 206 Unplugged!!!Finally. I think it looks pretty good. Learn some great testing sites including Google Mobile Tester, Matt Kesley responsive tester, and I tried to download Xcode but it needed the Mojave op system and I'm currently using Sierra and am waiting to upgrade because I keep hearing there are lots of issues including slowing down of the system. Also got through a good section of the Treehouse Web Devel track doing the Bootstrap section. 
**Thoughts** Would like to keep going on Treehouse and finish the bootstrap and I think the Sass section. I could get a head start on wordpress or more likely spend a week trying to go back over javaScript yet again. 


### Day 17: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not as much progress today. I did read all the Skillcrush material on testing and made notes but did not go thru the website Unplugged with it yet. Hopefully tomorrow. I went into Treehouse for the first time in a while and did the first section for Bootstrap. Will continue that over the next week.  
**Thoughts** Testing tomorrow and more Bootstrap over the week. I'd like to do some research and find out how to read other peoples web code, forensics- like. When I look at dev tools can I know it's bootstrap, or wp or what framework they may have used. How can I decipher it better? 

### Day 16: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: It was a dark and stormy night. Still got my coding in. Mostly fixed the Unplugged site. It's running well on all 3 browsers. It is just still bugging me that the about page does not line up well at times between tablet to desktop. The contact area looks funky and doesn't quite line up with the footer. Finally left it at good-enough, after the class video said it doesn't have to be perfect. 
**Thoughts** Need to get through the final testing section. I think I did most of them, but will go over with fresh eyes tomorrow and hope to finally complete this. Need to get through Bootstrap and Sass tuts next. I'd like to take another crack at JS also. Wordpress waits after that. 

### Day 15: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Back to UnPlugged. Tried to straighten out the content-wrappers to make them cohesive and it feels just as bad as before. My major issue I'm still having is when the screen size moves into desktop 1200 and beyond, the footer content and the contact-content of the about page are not lining up correctly. Started not working smart and need to walk away for today. Other than that it's testing in Chrome and in Firefox just fine. 
**Thoughts** Going to try and work through the lining up one more time on a fresh day. After that, once I run it through on Safari, I should probably run it through the validators again and then SHIP IT!!!!


### Day 14: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Back to UnPlugged. I went through and validated html. Turns out that html5 is a bit fussy about the comments. So wherever I had a line of hypens to make a comment stand out (ex: <!------------------- HEADER --------------> ) it would flag it. I used spaces instead so now they look like this ( <!--          HEADER        -->). Also found out that the css validator doesn't like css variables, even though they are accepted across the board on browsers. Turns out this had been a know issue for over a year. Online advice was just to ignor the parse error message as long as the browser read it correctly. 
**Thoughts** Still left on unplugged, I need to test in different browsers. I want to try and clean up the css for the .content-wrappers. Made a chart of all the variations of width in each section in each media query. I think I can set one standard width per query and just have one or two sections vary to reduce the repeating code. 

### Day 13: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Cool! I worked on my first pure css image. I got stuck for the longest time not understanding why the z-index was not working! Turned out I forgot the . to make my class selector in css. Duh!! Set up my first little animal css in codepen. Also my first time using that tool. I think I like it. It's especially good for css illustrations since you can preview as you work. Would like to do the challenge everyday, but I think that might be too too much for girl!! 
**Thoughts** I would love to focus on what I think is referred to as creative css and animations. Besides these tuts which I can access through coding-artist.teachable.com, there is a nice tut in Lynda.com and I'm sure some on SkillShare. I'll try to work them in! 

### Day 12: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Better session today. Put in the font awesome officially. I had roughly figured it out before so I could preview the layout with real images. Had most of it right except did not place them inside a container. SC suggested using the <p> tag. I think with the features icons I had them in a figure. In the social icons they were wrapped in an anchor tag. After some playing around I nested the <a> and <i> tags each inside a div. That way I was able to make a round circle background for each icon. Was forced to give exact width and height to use border radius and make the circles. Otherwise they accomodate the shape of each icon. 
**Thoughts** There was a way to layer 2 fontawesome icons but it looked messier than just formatting the parent div. 
  PS. Want to work on creative css soon!! 
  
### Day 11: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Shorter day today. Did work on Unplugged - honestly forgot to write down what I did and now can't quite remember. I played with the map iframe because it didn't look quite right. Adjusted a few things. 
**Thoughts** There seems to be a weird lag when I load the page with the map embedded. Especially if I'm using the Dev tools, makes it really hard to scroll down and see the whole page. 

### Day 10: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued on Unplugged. Got all images (except icons) in and sized. Had to adjust many things for the media queries after changes were made to some images I had had as placeholders. 
**Thoughts** Learned for img tags to be responsive, you can place them inside a figure tag. The img can be set at 100% and the size of the container (figure) can be adjusted). This is what messed up some of my flex boxes, I had to insert a figure element where there was none before and the flex layout got disturbed. I've left a lot of commented out code behind, and probably some repetitive code as well. Will remove and clean at the very end. Should get the icons from fontawesome in next. 

### Day 9: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on the font styles for Unplugged. Still trying to use variables for at least the two main fonts so future projects might use variables for main colors and fonts to ease in switching out. 
**Thoughts** Still messed up trying to find em sizes coming out of PS comps. Measuring the fonts in PS should be accuarate, but doesn't seem to be. I think we know that the px font sizes in PS are not accurate (read somewhere that the px in graphics programs don't quite correlate to web browsers?). In any case suing the measuements to get started and then adjusting by eye. Also the font weights look slightly off as well. Still not quite understanding why we want to use ems and not rems. Maybe I will ask that in the Slack channel.

### Day 8: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the responsive layouts for tablet and desktop on the unplugged project. Starting to get the hang of it. Did the quiz at the end of the section. Not satisfied with the answers. Esp. how should you organize your CSS. The official answer was by section top to bottom, but I swear that they suggested layout, colors, fonts, etc.. Also didn't know know 400 was a normal breakpoint. Oh well. 
**Thoughts** Moving forward to fonts and colors on the unplugged project tommorow. Since I incorporated background colors and most fonts colors as white already, I'm hoping this should go smoothly. Once the fonts are correct and I can put in font sizes — they layout should hopefully start looking right. Might need to adjust margins and paddings once those are in. By then again, should probably wait until after the images are correctly in place too. 

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Instead of working on Skillcrush, I set up a simple webpage to practice specific tasks. Today I set up a 6 block responsive section with flex box.Intend to continue to add specific sections to practice coding. 
**Thoughts** Add images to make them responsive over the next few days.  

### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Unplugged. First had to work with git to separate out just the unplugged files into their own repo (instead of the whole responsive 206 group I had it in). Was able to clone it to my local drive, initiate a new repo locally, and then init the remote repo (yeah!!) The problem after that was I was missing some CSS work on the media queries. I was able to figure out (eventually) that I had somehow swapped css files. Worked with flex groups in the tablet layout and got a rough layout going (again — eventually). 
**Thoughts** My code is probably a mess, but at least I am problem solving step by step.  

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: NO ACTUAL CODING TODAY
**Thoughts** Slack meeting with the group. Incorporating #100 days into our slack group. Also began Learning how to Learn class through Coursera. 


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Treehouse workshop on CSS variables. Worked on CSS for layout on Unplugged. I was able to incorporate the css variables for background color dark and background color light.

**Thoughts** Still having issues matching the layout BUT not sure if it's because not all the objects are in yet or whether I just made mistakes earlier on. 

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little further on UnPlugged project in 206 Skillcrush. Figured out how to include fontawesome icons. Added in some rough flex layout with a few margins and padding. Need to do the same for the about page and the faq page.

**Thoughts** I find it difficult to exactly replicate how Skillcrush has the code written. Makes more sense if I imitate it in a way that makes sense to me but I'm worried it will further confuse the issue if I need help down the road. 

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on Skillcrush 206, building CSS for the layout, adding display:flex and beginning to set widths and margins for Unplugged site

**Thoughts**: Really confused at least with how Skillcrush has you go through it. Trying to add in images and backgrounds so I can see what I'm doing in the browser. Had to check out Font Awesome, and have the download code I need to link and test out how it works for the icons on the main page.

**Link(s) to work**: www.fontawesome.com

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Treehouse, Web Design Track, CSS Grid, final section on using Firefox developer tools with Grid, and did a Practice grid layout

**Thoughts:** Need more practice but makes good sense.
