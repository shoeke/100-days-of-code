# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Treehouse, Web Design Track, CSS Grid, final section on using Firefox developer tools with Grid, and did a Practice grid layout

**Thoughts:** Need more practice but makes good sense.


### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on Skillcrush 206, building CSS for the layout, adding display:flex and beginning to set widths and margins for Unplugged site

**Thoughts**: Really confused at least with how Skillcrush has you go through it. Trying to add in images and backgrounds so I can see what I'm doing in the browser. Had to check out Font Awesome, and have the download code I need to link and test out how it works for the icons on the main page.

**Link(s) to work**: www.fontawesome.com


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
