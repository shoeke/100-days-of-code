# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Unplugged. First had to work with git to separate out just the unplugged files into their own repo (instead of the whole responsive 206 group I had it in). Was able to clone it to my local drive, initiate a new repo locally, and then init the remote repo (yeah!!) The problem after that was I was missing some CSS work on the media queries. I was able to figure out (eventually) that I had somehow swapped css files. Worked with flex groups in the tablet layout and got a rough layout going (again â€” eventually). 
**Thoughts** My code is probably a mess, but at least I am problem solving step by step.  

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: NO ACTUAL CODING TODAY
**Thoughts** Slack meeting with the group. Incorporating #100 days into our slack group. Also began Learning how to Learn class through Coursera. 


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Treehouse workshop on CSS variables. Worked on CSS for layout on Unplugged. I was able to incorporate the css variables for background color dark and background color light.

**Thoughts** Still having issues matching the layout BUT not sure if it's because not all the objects are in yet or whether I just made mistakes earlier on. 

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little further on UnPlugged project in 206 Skillcrush. Figured out how to include fontawesome icons. Added in some rough flex layout with a few margins and padding. Need to do the same for the about page and the faq page.

**Thoughts** I find it difficult to exactly replicate how Skillcrush has the code written. Makes more sense if I imitate it in a way that makes sense to me but I'm worried it will further confuse the issue if I need help down the road. 

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on Skillcrush 206, building CSS for the layout, adding display:flex and beginning to set widths and margins for Unplugged site

**Thoughts**: Really confused at least with how Skillcrush has you go through it. Trying to add in images and backgrounds so I can see what I'm doing in the browser. Had to check out Font Awesome, and have the download code I need to link and test out how it works for the icons on the main page.

**Link(s) to work**: www.fontawesome.com

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Treehouse, Web Design Track, CSS Grid, final section on using Firefox developer tools with Grid, and did a Practice grid layout

**Thoughts:** Need more practice but makes good sense.
