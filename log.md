# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the responsive layouts for tablet and desktop on the unplugged project. Starting to get the hang of it. Did the quiz at the end of the section. Not satisfied with the answers. Esp. how should you organize your CSS. The official answer was by section top to bottom, but I swear that they suggested layout, colors, fonts, etc.. Also didn't know know 400 was a normal breakpoint. Oh well. 
**Thoughts** Moving forward to fonts and colors on the unplugged project tommorow. Since I incorporated background colors and most fonts colors as white already, I'm hoping this should go smoothly. Once the fonts are correct and I can put in font sizes — they layout should hopefully start looking right. Might need to adjust margins and paddings once those are in. By then again, should probably wait until after the images are correctly in place too. 

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Instead of working on Skillcrush, I set up a simple webpage to practice specific tasks. Today I set up a 6 block responsive section with flex box.Intend to continue to add specific sections to practice coding. 
**Thoughts** Add images to make them responsive over the next few days.

### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Unplugged. First had to work with git to separate out just the unplugged files into their own repo (instead of the whole responsive 206 group I had it in). Was able to clone it to my local drive, initiate a new repo locally, and then init the remote repo (yeah!!) The problem after that was I was missing some CSS work on the media queries. I was able to figure out (eventually) that I had somehow swapped css files. Worked with flex groups in the tablet layout and got a rough layout going (again — eventually). 
**Thoughts** My code is probably a mess, but at least I am problem solving step by step.  

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: NO ACTUAL CODING TODAY
**Thoughts** Slack meeting with the group. Incorporating #100 days into our slack group. Also began Learning how to Learn class through Coursera. 


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Treehouse workshop on CSS variables. Worked on CSS for layout on Unplugged. I was able to incorporate the css variables for background color dark and background color light.

**Thoughts** Still having issues matching the layout BUT not sure if it's because not all the objects are in yet or whether I just made mistakes earlier on. 

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little further on UnPlugged project in 206 Skillcrush. Figured out how to include fontawesome icons. Added in some rough flex layout with a few margins and padding. Need to do the same for the about page and the faq page.

**Thoughts** I find it difficult to exactly replicate how Skillcrush has the code written. Makes more sense if I imitate it in a way that makes sense to me but I'm worried it will further confuse the issue if I need help down the road. 

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on Skillcrush 206, building CSS for the layout, adding display:flex and beginning to set widths and margins for Unplugged site

**Thoughts**: Really confused at least with how Skillcrush has you go through it. Trying to add in images and backgrounds so I can see what I'm doing in the browser. Had to check out Font Awesome, and have the download code I need to link and test out how it works for the icons on the main page.

**Link(s) to work**: www.fontawesome.com

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Treehouse, Web Design Track, CSS Grid, final section on using Firefox developer tools with Grid, and did a Practice grid layout

**Thoughts:** Need more practice but makes good sense.
